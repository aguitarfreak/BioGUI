17 (of 17) markers to be included from [ ..\plink\extra.map ]
89 individuals read from [ ..\plink\extra.ped ] 
89 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
48 cases, 41 controls and 0 missing
44 males, 45 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 17 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.996034
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 17 SNPs
After filtering, 48 cases, 41 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 44 males, 45 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Filtering founders only ... 89 individuals remaining
